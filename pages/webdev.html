        <h2>&nbsp;My Tech Obsession</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;My tech obsession began at the age of 6 when I first encountered a Sinclair ZX Spectrum 128k tape loading computer at my friends house where I would go to play "Spin Dizzy" and "Robocop".
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Ever since then I have been fascinated by all things tech and gaming. I have been an I.T. hobbyist ever since.  I grew up playing on consoles like the sega "Master System", "SNES", "Playstation 2" and various "XBOX" flavours.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Naturally, I took an "A" level in Computing and took optional units in computing in the first year of my degree course learning OO programming languages like Java.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years I have taken an interest in networking and dynamic websites on the internet and have followed courses from <a href="https://udemy.com" target="__blank">udemy.com</a> to gain a better understanding of React, NextJS, node, npm and other Javascript frameworks for web development.

        <h2>&nbsp;Motivation for a Secure but Affordable Web Server</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to have a secure web server on which I could safely view and develop web pages easily without them being publicly viewable until I was ready to open up access to them.  
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;I also wanted to be able to create many web servers in isolation so that I could work on various projects with ease.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;And finally, I wanted to be able to do this without having to lease public I.P. addresses for each server that I was developing on.

        <h2>&nbsp;Elements of the Solution</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;OVH is a cloud services provider with data centres located around Europe. I rent a bare metal dedicated server from <a href="https://ovhcloud.com/en-gb" target="__blank">OVH</a>. You can click the link to see their website for more information.  
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Using their web interface I was able to install Proxmox VE 7, an open source hypervisor operating system that allows me to parcel the resources on the bare metal server into VMs and LXC containers.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;My first VM was built using the <a href="https://opnsense.org/" target="__blank">OPNsense</a> operating system and acts as the firewall and gateway for my private VLAN.  The great thing about OPNsense is that it supports integration with OpenVPN. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Using this functionality made it easier to install and configure the <a href="https://openvpn.net/community/" target="__blank">OpenVPN community edition</a> Virtual Private Network server.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;And finally, by installing the OpenVPN GUI client and configuring it with the credentials from my server on my home pc, I am able to connect to my web server using a VPN Tunnel so I can access the private VLAN behind the firewall as private addresses on my home LAN.

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is a schematic for the setup I am currently using. </p>

          <h2>&nbsp;Security, Accessibility and Utility</h2>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;This arrangement gives me a secure way to develop websites in fully tailored, seperated environments on a site-by-site basis whilst ensuring that nobody but me can view the site over the internet until I am ready to publish it.
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;It also gives me the flexibility to develop on different base operating systems and software configurations without the overhead of needing seperate I.P. addresses for every site I'm developing.
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, I have the ability to issue VPN server credentials so that, if needed, I could collaborate with other developers by giving them limited access to the private LAN on the server side from their home pcs.
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, it has been an interesting tool with which to learn more about networking with linux distributions and web servers in general.
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;It gives me an affordable, flexible and practical solution to all my web development needs.
