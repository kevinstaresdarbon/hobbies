        <h2>&nbsp;My MMO Obsession</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;My MMO obsession began in 2002 when a friend of mine introduced me to "Dark Ages of Camelot".  At the time the expansion "Trials of Atlantis" had just been released.  Before then I had never seen or played a massively multiplayer online game.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://darkageofcamelot.com/" target="__blank">DAoC</a> is a game based loosely upon three differing mythologies of the Norse, the Celts and Arthurian legend. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Naturally, being a fantasy MMO game with strong competitive and collaborative elements it ticked all of my boxes and I have played it off and on for over 21 years, along with Final Fantasy 11, Final Fantasy 14, Eve Online and World of Warcraft. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;I am waiting for a similiar fantasy MMO game to be publicly released for VR, at which point you'll probably need a crow bar to separate me from my headset.
